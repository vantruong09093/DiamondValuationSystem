    "A round cut diamond is one of the most popular and classic diamond shapes, known for its brilliant sparkle and timeless appeal. It is the most prevalent diamond shape and has been in high demand for centuries.\n\nThe round cut diamond, as the name suggests, is cut into a round shape with 58 facets, or flat polished surfaces, that are carefully positioned to maximize the stone's brilliance and fire. These facets are strategically placed to allow light to enter the diamond, reflect off the internal surfaces, and then refract back out, creating a dazzling display of brilliance.",  },

      "The oval cut diamond is a popular and elegant diamond shape known for its elongated, elliptical shape. It is a modified brilliant cut that retains many of the desirable characteristics of the round cut, while offering a unique and elongated appearance.\n\nThe oval cut diamond is characterized by its symmetrical shape and rounded ends. It typically has 56 to 58 facets, similar to the round cut diamond, which are strategically arranged to maximize brilliance and sparkle. The elongated shape of the oval cut creates an illusion of greater size, making it a popular choice for those seeking a larger-looking diamond.",

The pear cut gets its name from its distinctive shape, resembling a teardrop with a rounded end and a pointed end.\n\nThe pear cut diamond features 58 facets, carefully arranged to maximize the stone's brilliance and fire. The rounded end of the diamond is similar to the round cut, with a large and polished facet known as the 'table' that allows light to enter and reflect within the stone. The pointed end, resembling the marquise cut, adds a touch of elegance and uniqueness to the diamond.",

Unlike other diamond cuts that prioritize brilliance, the emerald cut is designed to showcase the diamond's clarity and color, as well as its unique 'hall of mirrors' effect.\n\nThe emerald cut diamond features a step-cut faceting pattern, which consists of long, rectangular facets that run parallel to the diamond's edges. These facets create a beautiful interplay of light and dark planes within the diamond, resembling a hall of mirrors effect. This distinct faceting style gives the emerald cut its signature look and enhances the diamond's inherent clarity and color.",

          A diamond is a gemstone that is prized for its brilliance and beauty.
          It is a transparent crystal made of carbon atoms arranged in a
          specific lattice structure. The most common shape for a cut diamond is
          the round brilliant, which features a circular outline and a large
          number of facets that maximize its sparkle and light reflection.
